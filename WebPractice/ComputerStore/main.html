                As of 2021, in American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook computer are used
                interchangeably; in other dialects of English one or the other may be preferred. The term 'notebook
                computers' or 'notebooks' originally referred to a specific size of laptop (originally smaller and
                lighter than mainstream laptops of the time),[2] the terms have come to mean the same thing and notebook
                no longer refers to any specific size.

                Laptops combine all the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer, including the
                display screen, small speakers, a keyboard, data storage device, sometimes an optical disc drive,
                pointing devices (such as a touchpad or pointing stick), with an operating system, a processor and
                memory into a single unit. Most modern laptops feature integrated webcams and built-in microphones,
                while many also have touchscreens. Laptops can be powered either from an internal battery or by an
                external power supply from an AC adapter. Hardware specifications, such as the processor speed and
                memory capacity, significantly vary between different types, models and price points.
